# Contract RAG Chatbot
This application is designed for users _managing extensive contract collections_,<br>
enabling them to efficiently find accurate information through a searchable contracts database.

Not only does it provide answers to user queries,<br> 
but it also references specific contract sections with grounding verification using _Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture._

Users can securely and privately upload and initiate their personalized contract databases via this app.

![GCP-Kodebox-diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e67ed66-3433-4545-b341-0289b364ae01)
### 1.	Uploading Contracts
  - Users upload PDF contracts via the app.
  - The uploaded PDFs are stored in Google Storage (GS).
  - A Google Cloud Function is triggered when the GS bucket is updated, importing the files into a datastore integrated with the Google Search App.

### 2.	Querying via Chatbot
  - Users ask questions through the chatbot.
  - The chatbot AI generates answers by searching the stored contracts using the Google Search App.
  - The response includes: The answer, Grounding verification, Metadata from referenced contracts.

### 3. Conversation Logging
  - Conversations are saved as sessions to improve answer accuracy and chatbot performance over time.
